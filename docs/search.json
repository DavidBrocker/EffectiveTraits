Variables containing metadata were removed as they were not vital to the analyses (Start Date, End Date, Duration, etc.).\nAfter the data was cleaned, trait names were extracted from the column names using regular expressions and the columns were then renamed.\n\n\nCode\n# Load in packages\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(labelled)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(huxtable)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(forcats)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(tidytext)\nlibrary(wordcloud2)\nlibrary(irr)\nlibrary(forcats)\nlibrary(hrbrthemes)\nlibrary(sysfonts)\nlibrary(Rfast)\n\n# Custom Functions\ndiscrete_tab &lt;- function(data,x){\n  name &lt;- \n    data |&gt; \n    select({{x}}) |&gt; \n    pull()\n  \n  tab &lt;- \n    name |&gt; \n    tabyl(show_NA = FALSE, show_missing_levels = FALSE) |&gt; \n    # Ignore Error for Now...\n    adorn_pct_formatting(,,,percent) |&gt; \n    rename_with(str_to_sentence) |&gt; \n    hux() |&gt; \n    theme_article() |&gt; \n    set_align(everywhere,everywhere,\".\") |&gt; \n    set_na_string(\"NA\")\n  \n  tab[1,] &lt;- c(str_to_sentence(x),\"N\",\"%\",\"Valid %\")\n  \n  tab\n}\n# Load data\net &lt;- read_sav(\"Dental+Hygiene+Student+Perceptions+of+Effective+and+Ineffective+Clinical+Teaching+and+Instruction_April+2,+2024_12.43.sav\")\n\n# Clean Data\net_cln &lt;- \n  et |&gt; \n  # Clean Names\n  clean_names() |&gt; \n  # Only Look at Complete Cases\n  filter(finished == 1) |&gt; \n  # Remove identifiers\n  select(-consent_form) |&gt; \n  # Select needed columns\n  select(!start_date:recorded_date) |&gt;\n  select(!recipient_last_name:user_language) |&gt; \n  rename_at(vars(dplyr::ends_with(\"rank\")), ~ paste0(\"effective_\",1:31)) |&gt; \n  rename_at(vars(dplyr::ends_with(\"rank_0\")), ~ paste0(\"ineffective_\", 1:26))\n\n# Get Variable Labels\nall_traits &lt;- \n  et_cln |&gt; \n  select(contains(\"effective\")) |&gt; \n  get_variable_labels() \n\n# Create RegEx Pattern\nfind_trait &lt;- function(x){\n  x &lt;- str_extract(x,\"(?&lt;=\\\\.{3}\\\\s)(.*)\")\n  x &lt;- str_extract(x, \"(!?-)(.*)(?=-)\",group = 2)\n  str_trim(x)\n}\n\n# Iterate Across Lists\ntrait_names &lt;- \n  map_df(all_traits,find_trait) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = effective_1:ineffective_26,\n               names_to = \"old\",\n               values_to = \"traits\")\n\n# Column Names Reflect Traits\n# Anchored at Approachable - Not Engaging\nall_traits &lt;- \n  et_cln |&gt; \n  select(!contains(\"group_\")) |&gt; \n  select(!contains(\"comments\")) |&gt; \n  rename_at(vars(effective_1:ineffective_26), ~ trait_names$traits)\n\n# Get Names for Effective and Ineffective\ntn &lt;- \n  trait_names |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    type = ifelse(str_detect(old,\"^ef\"),\n                  \"Effective\", \"Ineffective\"),\n    type = factor(type, ordered = TRUE)) |&gt; \n  select(-old) \n\n# Subset Effective and Ineffective Traits\nat_cln &lt;- \n  all_traits |&gt; \n  labelled::remove_labels() |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = Approachable:`Not engaging`,\n               names_to = \"traits\",\n               values_to = \"rating\") |&gt; \n  select(traits,rating) |&gt; \n  inner_join(tn, by = join_by(traits)) |&gt; \n  group_by(traits,rating)\n\n# Get Top Ranking Value of Each Trait and Rank\nat_cln_sort &lt;- \n  at_cln |&gt; \n  filter(rating == 1) |&gt; \n  add_count(sort = TRUE) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    ranking = rank(n,ties.method = \"first\"),\n    shift = ifelse(type == \"Effective\", n, -n)\n  ) |&gt; \n  group_by(type,traits,shift) |&gt; \n  count() |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  # Remove to Get All Data\n  top_n(20)\n\n\n\n\n515 participants took part in this study, of them 381 completed the study.

For example, if a trait was endorsed as being number 1 in terms of priority, it would be weighted as a 10.\n\nFor example: A set of 5 scores where Trait X is rated to be {1, 1, 1, 3, 5} would be converted to {10, 10, 10, 7, 5}. This would give Trait X a weighted ranking of 42. To delineate between effective and ineffective traits, all frequency counts in the ineffective traits were negated.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Get Weighting\nat_cln_ttl &lt;- \n  at_cln |&gt; \n  # Apply Weighting\n  mutate(\n    w_rating = case_when(\n    rating == 1 ~ 10,\n    rating == 2 ~ 9,\n    rating == 3 ~ 8,\n    rating == 4 ~ 7,\n    rating == 5 ~ 6,\n    rating == 6 ~ 5,\n    rating == 7 ~ 4,\n    rating == 8 ~ 3,\n    rating == 9 ~ 2,\n    rating == 10 ~ 1\n  )) |&gt; \n  group_by(traits,type) |&gt;\n  summarize(total = sum(w_rating,na.rm = TRUE),\n            .groups = \"keep\") |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  # filter(total &gt; 600) |&gt; \n  mutate(total = ifelse(type == \"Ineffective\",-total,total))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe traits for both effective and ineffective traits are compared by their respective weights and visualized only with traits over 500 weight.\n\n\nCode\n# Plot: Effective\nap1 &lt;- \n  at_cln_ttl |&gt; \n  filter(type == \"Effective\") |&gt; \n  filter(total &gt; 500) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(traits,total),total)) + \n    geom_segment(aes(\n      x = traits, xend = traits,\n      y = total, yend = 0,\n      color = ifelse(total == max(total), \"#E39774\",\"grey50\")),\n      lty = 3) +\n  geom_point(\n    size = 12,\n    aes(\n      color = ifelse(total == max(total),\"#E39774\",\"grey5 0\"))) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  geom_text(aes(\n    label = total),\n    size = 3,\n    color = \"cornsilk\") + \n  labs(\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"\",\n    color = \"\",\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_markdown(size = 15,\n                                  face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_markdown(),\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(hjust = 0,face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n    ) +\n  scale_color_identity() + ylim(0,1550)\n\n# Plot: Ineffective\nap2 &lt;- \n  at_cln_ttl |&gt; \n  filter(type == \"Ineffective\") |&gt; \n  filter(total &lt; -500) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(traits,total),total)) + \n    geom_segment(aes(\n      x = traits, xend = traits,\n      y = total, yend = 0,\n      color = ifelse(total == min(total), \"#326273\",\"grey50\")),\n      lty = 3) +\n  geom_point(\n    size = 12,\n    aes(\n      color = ifelse(total == min(total),\"#326273\",\"grey5 0\"))) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  geom_text(aes(\n    label = total),\n    size = 3,\n    color = \"cornsilk\") + \n  labs(\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"\",\n    color = \"\",\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_markdown(size = 15,\n                                  face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_markdown(),\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(hjust = 0,face = \"bold\",size = 12),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n    ) +\n  scale_color_identity() +\n  scale_x_discrete(position = \"top\")\n\npl &lt;- ap2 / ap1\n\ntitle_label &lt;- \"What Makes A 'Good' (or 'Bad') Instructor?\"\n\nsubtitle_label &lt;- \n\"The most &lt;span style = 'color: #326273'&gt;**Ineffective instructors**&lt;/span&gt; provide poor guidance and are unapproachable, while the most &lt;span style = 'color: #E39774'&gt;**Effective instructors**&lt;/span&gt; are invested in students success and are approachable,while the most  All traits are weighted by the combined sum of ranking from a scale of 1-10.\"\n\npl + \n  plot_layout(ncol = 2, \n              nrow = 1) + \n  plot_annotation(\n    title = title_label,\n    subtitle = subtitle_label,\n    theme = \n      theme(\n        plot.subtitle = \n          element_textbox_simple(\n            size = 20,\n            padding  = margin(5.5, 0, 5.5, 5.5),\n            margin = margin(1, 0, 5.5, 0),\n            r = grid::unit(4,\"pt\"),\n            width = unit(.6,\"npc\"),\n            hjust = 0,\n            linewidth = .5,\n            linetype = 1,\n            ),\n       plot.title = element_markdown(\n         face = \"bold\",\n         size = 30)\n       ))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSub-themes were classified based on previous work by Pizanis (2023).

For example, if a trait was endorsed as being number 1 in terms of priority, it would be weighted as a 10.\n\nFor example: A set of 5 scores where Trait X is rated to be {1, 1, 1, 3, 5} would be converted to {10, 10, 10, 7, 5}. This would give Trait X a weighted ranking of 42.
